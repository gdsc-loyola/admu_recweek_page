              On behalf of the Executive Board and each department, we believe that <b>you will bring something
                very awesome to our humble community.</b> It's just saddening that we are still in quarantine and
              can't personally meet you one by one but nevertheless, we can't wait to see what you will
              accomplish and how you will help us <b>uplift communities through technology.</b>
